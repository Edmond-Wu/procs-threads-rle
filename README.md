# procs-threads-rle
C program to test threading and multi-processing on a modified version of the RLE compression algorithm. There are 2 separate C executables: compressT_LOLS and compressR_LOLS

## Compiling and running
A makefile is provided for compilation, and both executables take the same input form, with the first argument being a file containing the uncompressed string, and the second argument being the number of parts to split the compressed string into.
